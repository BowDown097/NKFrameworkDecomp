'TiCPP' is short for the official name TinyXML++. It is a completely new interface to TinyXML (http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/) that uses MANY of the C++ strengths. Templates, exceptions, and much better error handling. It is also fully documented in doxygen. It is really cool because this version let's you interface tiny the exact same way as before or you can choose to use the new 'ticpp' classes. All you need to do is define TIXML\_USE\_TICPP. It has been tested in VC 6.0, VC 7.0, VC 7.1, VC 8.0, MinGW gcc 3.4.5, and in Linux GNU gcc 3+.
